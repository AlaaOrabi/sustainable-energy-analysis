This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning (ML) on a global sustainable energy dataset. It provides insights into electricity access, energy consumption, and CO₂ emissions across countries and examines the relationship between these factors. Furthermore, the project uses machine learning models to predict CO₂ emissions based on energy indicators.
